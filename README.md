#  Playwright Testing Framework for UI + API (TypeScript + Cucumber)

## üìå What Is It?

This is an automated testing framework built using Playwright and TypeScript supporting both **UI** and **API** testing. It follows **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** principles using **Cucumber** and **Gherkin syntax**, and applies the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for scalability and reusability.

##  Key Features

- üîπ Unified support for UI and API automation  
- üîπ BDD with Cucumber and Gherkin syntax  
- üîπ Page Object Model (POM) architecture  
- üîπ Modular & reusable utilities  
- üîπ Auto-generated HTML reports with screenshots  
- üîπ Scalable & easily maintainable project structure

## Tech Stack

| Tool        | Purpose                      |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Playwright  | UI & API automation testing  |
| TypeScript  | Strongly typed scripting     |
| Cucumber    | BDD-style testing framework  |
| Node.js     | JavaScript runtime engine    |

---

## Pre-requisites

Ensure the following tools are installed before running the project:

| Tool       | Required Version     |
|------------|----------------------|

##  Project Setup (Local Environment)

```bash
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the project directory
cd Playwright-Test-Automation-Framework-for-UI-API

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install project dependencies

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Executing Tests

To run all tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

---

## Test Reports

After execution:

-  **HTML-Cucumber Report** is generated automatically at:  
  `./src/test-result/reports/`

-  **Screenshots** of test success/failures are stored at:  
  `./src/test-result/screenshots/`

---

 **Note:**  
For additional planned scenarios and test cases (including both UI and API), refer to:  
[`additional-testscenarios.md`](./additional-testscenarios.md)

##  File Structure Overview

| Folder/File             | Purpose                                                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/`                  | Main test library (features, page objects, steps, utilities)           |
| `test-result/`          | Stores test output (screenshots, reports)                              |
| `tsconfig.json`         | TypeScript compiler configuration                                      |
| `cucumber.json`         | Cucumber settings (feature paths, steps, reporting, modules)           |
| `package.json`          | Project metadata, dependencies, scripts                                |
| `package-lock.json`     | Dependency tree lock for reproducibility                               |

## Key Folder Breakdown

###  `src/test/pageObjects/`
- `.ts` files for both UI (**SauceDemo**) and API (**Swagger Petstore**)
- Central repository of reusable web locators and methods (POM pattern)

###  `src/test/features/`
- Contains `.feature` files written in **Gherkin BDD syntax**
  - `ui/` ‚Üí UI scenarios
  - `api/` ‚Üí API scenarios

###  `src/test/steps/`
- Step definition files (glue code between Gherkin steps & logic)

###  `src/test/utilities/`
- Shared utility/helper modules reused across the project (follows **DRY** principle)

###  `src/test-result/reports/`
- Auto-generated HTML reports (Cucumber format)

###  `src/test-result/screenshots/`
- Screenshots of test failures for visual debugging
